# Realtime Simulation Using 3DsMax & Arduino
Visualizing a 3D simulation of a robot odomatry using the data from joystick, you can also edit this to read data from encoder. This was aimed to be an idea for minesweepers competition on 2014.

# Explanation:
   - I added detailed comments on the 2 files the ```.ino``` file and the ```.ms``` file.
   
# Steps:
   1- You start by uploding the ardunio code[the ```.ino``` file] to ardunio, you can use simple hardware as start to try it. Ex: 2 potentiometers[X,Y] and a push button [Metal Detector] ...
   2- Run the ```.max```, open the Max script file ```.ms``` and run it as well.
   3- Now you can turn the potentiometers to see the robot moving and press the push button to land a mine in your current postion. 
   4- Fabricate it for your own robot and uses. ex: joystick or even encoders and metal detector on a real robot...

# How will it look:
